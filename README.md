# declaration

DRAFT

A web page where user can read and sign a declaration that:

* fossil fuel production is a crime
* we intend to bring about a world where those responsible will be brought to account, and those who have been sentenced for defending the world will be pardoned.

The DRAFT page can be seen at [/we-declare.github.io/declaration/](https://we-declare.github.io/declaration/)

## To do:

* work on declaration wording
* decide on how signup works
  * email? What about privacy concerns?
  * zip/postcode? (A world map would be nice)
* make it look good
  * make it look good when posted on social media
* translations
* get a domain
